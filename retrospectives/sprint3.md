### Detailed statistics

Average hours per task: 58.5/27 = 2.16 

| Story ID | Number of tasks | Points | Hours estimated | Hours Spent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6  | 0 | 8 | 2 | 2 |
| 10  | 3 | 5 | 4.5 | 4.5 |
| 11  | 3 | 13 | 13 | 12 |

| Horizontal Task ID | Number of tasks | Hours estimated | Hours Spent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 83 | 0 | 1.5 | 1.5 |

Task estimation error ratio: 60/58.5 = 1.02

## Quality
### Unit testing
Unit testing was carried out only on the back-end due to time limitations. The following statistics are not precise since learning testing and implement tests were activities carried out almost at the same time. 

| Hours estimated | Hours spent |
| --- | --- |
| 3.5 | 3.5 |

Automated unit tests: 18  
Coverage(measured only on back end): 5%  

### Code review
| Hours estimated | Hours spent |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 3 |

## Assessment
We are proud we have completed all the stories committed in the sprint planning, even if it required more effort than expected. The reason of such an error in estimation is that we underestimated the time required for merging code and fixing bugs. In this sprint we've learnt that we need to pay more attention during estimation.
